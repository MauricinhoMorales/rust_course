/*
Declare a `is_concert` variable set to a boolean.
Declare a `is_event` variable assigned to `is_concert`.
Will Rust move ownership? State your answer, then confirm
by trying to printing both variables out.

Declare a `sushi` variable to set to a string literal of "Salmon"
Declare a `dinner` variable assigned to the `sushi` variable.
Will Rust move ownership? State your answer, then confirm
by trying to printing both variables out.

Repeat the previous example but use a heap String instead.
Will Rust move ownership? Explain why the result is different
from the previous operation.

The `clear` method modifies a heap String to have no content.
Declare an `eat_meal` function that accepts a `meal` parameter
of type String. In the body of `eat_meal`, invoke the `clear`
method on the `meal` parameter.

In the `main` function, invoke the `eat_meal` function and pass
in your "Salmon" String. Explain what happens when the eat_meal
function runs. Describe the complete movement of ownership of
the "Salmon" String throughout the program.

Say we want to keep the String around after `eat_meal` is
called. How can we continue to have access to the String in
the `main` function? Print out the (empty) String.

Let's model a road trip!

Define a `start_trip` function that creates and returns
a String of "The plan is..."

Invoke the `start_trip` function in `main` and save its
return value to a `trip` variable.

We want to pass the String to three separate functions
that will mutate the String without transferring ownership.

Define a `visit_philadelphia` function that concatenates
the text "Philadephia" to the end of the String. Invoke
the function in `main`. Then, invoke `push_str` on the String
to concatenate the content " and " to the end. Mak sure to
include the spaces.

Define a `visit_new_york` function that concatenates the
text "New York" to the end of the String. Invoke the function
in `main`. Repeat the previous logic to concatenate " and "
to the end of the String.

Define a `visit_boston` function that concatenates the
text "Boston." to the end of the String. Invoke the function
in `main`. Concatenate a period to the end of the
String/sentence.

Define a `show_itinerary` function that will print out
the final version of the String. Find a way to do so
without transferring ownership.

Invoke `show_itinerary`. The final output should be:

"The plan is...Philadelphia and New York and Boston."
